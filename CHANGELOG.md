## 0.13.4
Importing `FBSDKCoreKit_Basics` as a real fix for [#127](https://github.com/oddbit/flutter_facebook_app_events/issues/127) and [#129](https://github.com/oddbit/flutter_facebook_app_events/issues/129). See PR [#131](https://github.com/oddbit/flutter_facebook_app_events/pull/131). The PR adds back support for `setUserData` in iOS during deprecation grace period.

## 0.13.3
**N.B. Workaround release!!**
Removing function body for iOS handling of deprecated method `setUserData`. See issues [#127](https://github.com/oddbit/flutter_facebook_app_events/issues/127) and [#129](https://github.com/oddbit/flutter_facebook_app_events/issues/129). We 
were unable to reproduce or successfully troubleshoot the reported problems within the team and decided that it would be 
better to get around the compilation error with the sacrifice of the `setUserData` in the possibly short time before it
is removed from the SDK anyway.
